<p>Diana Ross has remained a golden fixture in the fashion world since she began her career with The Supremes, formerly known as the Primettes, in 1959. This is a timeline of some of her most prevalent attires, following her development of style through the 70s. Many of the included pieces were creative collaborations between her and Bob Mackie, who acted as her stylist throughout her career. I always appreciated Diana for the show-stopper that she was and especially because she is living proof of how a girl can have fun in many different walks of life.</p>
