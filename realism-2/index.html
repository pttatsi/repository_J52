<p>Realism exists across various forms of art and has changed by definition with time. In literature, realism refers to the portrayal of everyday life, focusing on accurate and detailed representation of social, economic, and political realities. Realist proletarian literature specically focuses on the experiences of the working class, putting into forms that are more familiar and digestible for the reader, anyone outside of this situation can identify with a character's position and thus start toquestion the forces that put that character in that position.</p>

<p> In order to understand the importance of realism in proletarian literature and how it provides a framework to portray women and their intersectional identities, I am going to discuss Kang Kyŏng-ae’s fictional novel From Wŏnso Pond, with a focus on two of its central characters, Sonbi and Ockhom’s mother, alongside Alifa Rifaat’s The long Night of Winter. These characters are vastly different in terms of their class, social and economic status, they differ in how they are written and who they are based on, yet they serve the same purpose. Understanding that purpose is synonymous with understanding realism as not concerned with putting characters in ideal situations that removes the reader from their present world but rather concerned with informing the reader about the world around them.</p>
          
<p> Realism, when intertwined with the concept of intersectionality—the recognition that people’s identities and experiences are shaped by a multiplicity of factors—becomes a potent tool for exploring the nuanced lives of individuals, particularly women. This is particularly important when discussing the trajectory of characters like Sonbi in From Wonso Pond, how and where it started as opposed to how and where it ended. It is one thing to blatantly state that capitalism is a machine that strips people of individuality,transforming ways of life centered around communal living and feudalism, further dividing people into clashing categories but another thing to observe texts such as From W onso Pond and The Long Night of Winter that strive to show how big concepts and social machines like capitalism, classism, misogyny and intersectionality work to influence people's lives, their environment and the different positions and choices it put onto people, leaving them in standstills either dispossessed or without a way forward.</p>
          
<p>From Wonso Pond immerses readers in the lives of Korean women during the Japanese colonial era, meticulously capturing the intersections of gender, class, and cultural identity. In the novel, Sonbi, a poor peasant woman, represents the marginalized working class, especially women who do house-hold work. Her experiences are defined by the intersection of her gender and economic status, further emphasized after she loses both her parents and is ultimately dispossessed when she moves into Tokho’s house to work as a house servant. As a woman, she faces societal restrictions and patriarchal norms, limiting her agency and opportunities. Moreover, her impoverished background exacerbates her challenges, highlighting the inseparable link between gender and class.</p>
          
<p>In chapter 15 of From Wonso Pond, Sonbi’s mother passes away and she has to become a house-servant to T okho and his wife. The house that was in her family’s possession is stripped from her presumably because she has no means to sustain herself financially and upkeep the house. She is essentially dispossessed of any property and as a result has to sell her labour as a means to have a roof over her head. Kang uses this allegory to show how “the enclosures of common lands…sever the direct relationship of peasant to her own means of subsistence…a process that generates the primitive accumulation of capital essential to kickstart and sustain capitalism” (Ferguson, 6).</p>
          
<p>In this household, Sonbi faces abuse from not only Tokho and his sexual violations but also from Okchom and her unnamed mother. Okchom’s mother, whose lack of a name shows that her identity revolves around her marriage, similar to that of Zennouba, therefore only being referred to as the product of that marriage, is illiterate because she lacks access to education. She is a housewife who never does any housework because she believes she is above it. According to Ferguson, the issue with housework labour is not about the difficulty of it because it is necessary for human life to prevail, it is the devaluation of that work and the subsequent oppression of those who do it. Okchom’s mother’s housewification is only possible because“households that could afford to, adopted the ideals of genteel domesticity and cleanliness, transferring the heavier, difficult, and dirty tasks from wives and daughters to servant women and girls' ' (Ferguson, 18). This is where intersectionality comes into play again because while Okchom’s mother has the power to oppress another she is also simultaneously being oppressed by her husband and society at large.</p>

<p>Through the protagonist, in The Long Night of Winter, Rifaat brings to light the challenges faced by women in a conservative society where traditional norms intersect with modern expectations.The novel explores the intersection of gender and religious identity. The protagonist’s internal conflict between her faith and her desire for autonomy is a striking portrayal of the complex relationship between religious norms and women’s agency. Zennouba is married to her cousin, Hagg Hamdan,which was an economic move on her family’s part to keep the land in the family. This is the first instance of her objectification. However, her husband constantly cheats on her by violating the younger girls (which adds another layer of oppression that exists in the household, dispossessed and sexual exploitation) that come to their house from the village to work as house-servants. His apologies are given to her in the form of jewelry furthering the objectification she has faced for most of her life. Rather than actively trying to preserve their marriage through faithfulness or loyalty, her husband disregards her concerns and desires.</p>

<div class="callout customCallout">
<p> “The following day he had brought her a pair of gold earrings and had kissed her head affectionately. Yet, with the passing of time, such nights were repeated and gifts of gold jewelry were made to her, while the girl servants came and went at his bidding without apparent reason, for he was the master of the house…W as this the fate of all women? …the pent-up hatred against him had long ago changed to a cold contempt; the hopes that things would change had now gone, but the ache to love and be loved was still there, as physically part of her as her sight or sense of smell” (pg. 57-58).</p></div>

<p>In Ferguson’s Women and Work, Kollontai and Zetkin’s stance is that women’s experiences of oppression vary by class position and that working class women’s oppression is integral to the very conditions that sustain the lives of wealthy women (pg.25). Zennouba’s desire to have a modern marriage in which she is not the sole provider of love but also the recipient of it as opposed to the traditional arranged marriage she finds herself in, is representative of women around the world who are caught in subversive marriages with husbands that emotionally and physically devalue them. However,Zennouba’s class status puts her in the same situation that she seeks to free herself from without her realizing. The girls who come to her house to serve her not only have to deal with her husband’s sexual violation but also her aversion towards them for his actions.</p>

<p> What is interesting about comparing Sonbi/Okchom to Zennouba/the servant girls in her home is being able to see how both wives directly approach their husband’s actions. In chapter 75, Sonbi is brutally beaten by Okchom’s mother after she breaks a gourd.</p>

<div class="callout customCallout">
<p>“Now, get out of here, you bitch! And to think I raised you like my very own daughter . . . If you’d ever used that head on your shoulders, you might have at least thought about that. But instead you have the gall to . . . Oh, I knew all along what you two were up to, though I held my tongue. You little slut!” (pg. 254)</p></div>

<p>It is clear that the reason she attacks Sonbi in such a brutal way, taking out chunks of her hair and giving her hard slaps across her face, is not because of the broken gourd but because of the tension that has built between them as a result of Tokho’s violation of Sonbi and the other girls who have met the same fate in their home. She reveals that she has had her suspicions but at the same time, it is revealed by the structure of the dialogue (what she chooses not to say) that she is not going to confront Tokho about this. In addition, she isn’t confronting Tokho because he holds all the power, just as Sonbi is dispossessed and uneducated, so is she without this marriage.</p>

<p>Similarly, Zennouba finds herself in this situation, choosing how to react to the girls in her home. Her narrative is told much di erently from Okchom’s mother in that her actions and language are more passive and recluse whereas Okchom’s mother’s language is abrasive, accusatory, and overt. Zennouba reflects her mortality onto Nargis, lamenting about her younger body indicating that she
isn’t blaming the girls for her husband’s actions but rather her aging body. This is further emphasized with the description of a spluttering lamp and the greyness of dawn, all things that indicate aging or oldness. Her affliction towards Nargis is very covert but also disruptive. She makes Nargis scrub her back bare chested, which is completely unnecessary for Nargis to complete the even more unnecessary task of washing Zennouba. She uses her power as a woman of higher standing to compel Nargis, putting her into an uncomfortable position that violates her autonomy. Like Okchom’s mother, despite her oppression she still has the ability to oppress others.</p>

<p>The work of realism in this context is to essentially pull apart those threads of social classifications that intersect to try and understand what change can be made once it has been properly examined. Kang Kyŏng-ae’s "From W ŏnso Pond"
and Alifa Rifaat’s "The Long Night of Winter" stand as powerful literary explorations of women’s intersectionality. Though Okchom’s mother, Sonbi, and
Zennouba are vastly different characters, their individual lives are defined by shared multifaceted factors, undoubtedly linking gender and class.</p>
