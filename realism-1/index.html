  <p>Realism exists across various forms of art and has changed by definition with time. In literature, realism refers to the portrayal of everyday life, focusing on accurate and detailed representation of social, economic, and political realities. Realist proletarian literature specically focuses on the experiences of the working class, putting into forms that are more familiar and digestible for the reader, anyone outside of this situation can identify with a character's position and thus start toquestion the forces that put that character in that position.</p>


  <p> In order to understand the importance of realism in proletarian literature and how it provides a framework to portray women and their intersectional identities, I am going to discuss Kang Kyŏng-ae’s fictional novel From Wŏnso Pond, with a focus on two of its central characters, Sonbi and Ockhom’s mother, alongside Alifa Rifaat’s The long Night of Winter. These characters are vastly different in terms of their class, social and economic status, they differ in how they are written and who they are based on, yet they serve the same purpose. Understanding that purpose is synonymous with understanding realism as not concerned with putting characters in ideal situations that removes the reader from their present world but rather concerned with informing the reader about the world around them.</p>

  <p> Realism, when intertwined with the concept of intersectionality—the recognition thatpeople’s identities and experiences are shaped by a multiplicity of factors—becomes a potent tool for exploring the nuanced lives of individuals, particularly women. This is particularly important when discussing the trajectory of characters like Sonbi in From W onso Pond, how and where it started as opposed to how and where it ended. It is one thing to blatantly state that capitalism is a machine that strips people of individuality,transforming ways of life centered around communal living and feudalism, further dividing people into clashing categories but another thing to observe texts such as From W onso Pond and The Long Night of Winter that strive to show how big concepts and social machines like capitalism, classism, misogyny and intersectionality work to influence people's lives, their environment and the different positions and choices it put onto people, leaving them in standstills either dispossessed or without a way forward.</p>

<p>From Wonso Pond immerses readers in the lives of Korean women during the Japanese colonial era, meticulously capturing the intersections of gender, class, and cultural identity. In the novel, Sonbi, a poor peasant woman, represents the marginalized working class, especially women who do house-hold work. Her experiences are defined by the intersection of her gender and economic status, further emphasized after she loses both her parents and is ultimately dispossessed when she moves into Tokho’s house to work as a house servant. As a woman, she faces societal restrictions and patriarchal norms, limiting her agency and opportunities. Moreover, her impoverished background exacerbates her challenges, highlighting the inseparable link between gender and class.</p>

<p>In chapter 15 of From Wonso Pond, Sonbi’s mother passes away and she has to become a house-servant to T okho and his wife. The house that was in her family’s possession is stripped from her presumably because she has no means to sustain herself financially and upkeep the house. She is essentially dispossessed of any property and as a result has to sell her labour as a means to have a roof over her head. Kang uses this allegory to show how “the enclosures of common lands…sever the direct relationship of peasant to her own means of subsistence…a process that generates the primitive accumulation of capital essential to kickstart and sustain capitalism” (Ferguson, 6).</p>

<p>In this household, Sonbi faces abuse from not only T okho and his sexual violations but also from Okchom and her unnamed mother. Okchom’s mother, whose lack of a name shows that her identity revolves around her marriage, similar to that of Zennouba, therefore only being referred to as the product of that marriage, is illiterate because she lacks access to education. She is a housewife who never does any housework because she believes she is above it. According to Ferguson, the issue with housework labour is not about the difficulty of it because it is necessary for human life to prevail, it is the devaluation of that work and the subsequent oppression of those who do it. Okchom’s mother’s
housewification is only possible because“households that could afford to, adopted the ideals of genteel domesticity and cleanliness, transferring the heavier, difficult, and dirty tasks from wives and daughters to servant women and girls' ' (Ferguson, 18). This is where intersectionality comes into play again
because while Okchom’s mother has the power to oppress another she is also simultaneously being oppressed by her husband and society at large.</p>
