<p>As the world grapples with the escalating environmental and ethical concerns posed by fast fashion, thrifting emerges as both a stylish solution and a personal adventure.</p>

<div class="callout customCallout">
	<p>“I’m kind of exchanging my clothes for a new style. Reduce, reuse, recycle.”</p></div>

<p>According to the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/03/1035161" target="_blank">UN Environment Programme</a>,fast fashion is responsible for about 10% of global carbon emissions and significant water usage–producing a single cotton shirt consumes approximately 700 gallons of water, and a pair of jeans requires about 2,000 gallons.</p>

<p>Thrifting offers a compelling counter-narrative to the dire environmental impacts of the fast fashion industry by promoting sustainable and ethical consumption practices though the act of thrifting can be <a href="https://emorywheel.com/thrifting-should-bring-sustainability-not-neoliberal-fashion/" target="_blank">victim to overconsumption</a>. Consumers around the world typically buy more clothes than they can wear, mostly due to the constant shifts in mainstream fashion.</p>

<p> Instead of supporting the rapid production cycles, low-cost materials, and exploitative labour practices characteristic of fast fashion, thrifting extends the lifecycle of clothing and reduces waste.</p>

<p>“Most companies that engage in fast fashion rely on the labour of children, of marginalized and vulnerable populations in the global South,” says Diya Shah, an undergraduate UMD student majoring in History and Journalism, “I can’t stand by that, which is why I enjoy thrifting.”</p>

<h2 class="poppins-black"><strong>One in a Million-</strong></h2>
<p>Beyond its environmental benefits, thrifting offers an electrifying experience that resonates with those seeking to expand their closets. In conversation with Shah, we discussed the ‘reuse, reduce, and recycle’ nature of thrifting.</p>

<p>“There are some days when I open my closet and I'm like, I have nothing here, nothing here identifies to the person I am anymore,” says Shah, “I’m kind of exchanging my clothes for a new style. Reduce, reuse, recycle.” </p>

<p>Thrifting also allows for self-expression through fashion, enabling one to develop a perpetually dynamic wardrobe. Unique finds, like a rare Vivienne Tam top discovered in Austin, signify more than just economic savings—they represent the discovery of rare, often irreplaceable pieces that carry their own stories. </p>

<p>Vivian Tam, a designer based in New York City, made a Buddha collection in the 90s where the image of Buddha appeared on different items of clothing. Shah recalls finding her favorite thrift find which happened to be a Vivienne Tam design. </p>

<p>“One time I was in Austin with my best friend and we were thrifting, and I found this Vivienne Tam, like, sheer, long-sleeved top,” says Shah, “My best friend and I, we've never gotten into a fight, but this is the one time we were gonna fight because both of us wanted it so bad…It was only $5 and it was the most beautiful top in the world.” </p>

<p>That same top retails for approximately 800 bucks. </p>

<p>"I have an ever-changing sense of style. I don't want to stick to a certain aesthetic or a certain look,” said Shah, “and thrifting so much gives me that. It allows me to be fluid in my fashion and my experience."</p>

<h2 class="poppins-black"><strong>Why you should Support your local Thrift–</strong></h2>
<p>As a student in College Park who loves and adores the act of thrifting, it is important to support local thrift shops and stores that often support charitable organizations, with proceeds from sales helping fun community projects or social services. While Value Village, College Park is a for-profit thrift store, they buy donated clothing from non-profit organizations that fund programs such as after-school activities for children in our communities.</p>
