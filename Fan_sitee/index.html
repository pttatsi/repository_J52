<P>This is where he drew the Claw shoe that is considered one of his<strong><em> most significant</em></strong> designs. Mcqueen can be personified as reflecting the ferocious inner life that influenced the audacity and self-referential aspects of his collections. He saw freedom as something that had to be expressed on one’s shoulder, saying “ I design clothes because I don’t want women to look all innocent and naïve… I want woman to look stronger…I’ve seen a woman get nearly beaten to death by her husband. I know what misogyny is… I want people to be afraid of the women I dress.”</P>
<p> Mcqueen’s work was hard-hitting and at times off-putting. He addressed the parts of life that were often overlooked on glamorous runways. I was first introduced to him in the 10th grade. I was beginning to understand my interest in fashion and understanding how i could use it to visually define myself. Finding Mcqueen was revolutionary for me, at that age it meant a lot to see someone whose personal history and experiences resonated so deeply in each design that he made. His philosophy was the guide to discovering the elements of fashion that allow the grotesque and the glamorous to have a seat at the table.</p>
